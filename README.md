# Hyrule-Compendium-js-app

## Intro

A small web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from the [Hyrule Compendium API]

This app contains all Creatures, Enemies, Materials, Weapons, and Treasure from the game Legenda of Zelda Breath of the Wild. And you also have the access to the details of each object.

## How I did make it

* At first I was searching for a matching design and layout
* Luckily I found an open-source Figma file for this project
* After I change the layout, like how it should look in the game
* Creating some animation and effects to make the page more alive
* Fetching Data from the API for the first time and getting everything I need
* Creating functions I need like filter/ search/ sort/ modal function
* Testing and debugging and making it responsive
* Done!




## For the Future Me

* Adding the annoying and beautiful sound effect would be nice on the background
* Adding a different mouse tracking function would be nice


## Learning Lessons

* Styling a Similar Layout with Figma
* JavaScript Fetching API
